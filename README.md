# Study Core
## 2019 HSC Software Design and Development project
This is the git repository for my high school software project in which I created a study app called `Study Core` for students or anyone that wants achieve a goal(s). 
### Purpose
The purpose of `Study Core` was to create a website where anyone can set any type of goal(s) in a way that keeps them on track to keep their goals to be achieved.

### Features 
* **Personalization:** Users able to create an account where their data is stored and can be retrieved at any time.

* **Goal setting:** A multi level goal setting system enables users to create a long term goal with steps along the way to ensure the long term goal is on track regularly.

* **Schedules:** Users are able to create a schedule tailored around a goal they set to allocate time to their goal to keep them on track.

* **Flexability:** There are no restraints on users when creating goals or schedules.
